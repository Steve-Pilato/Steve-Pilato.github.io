I am a data analyst and data manager at a small startup company as well as a data science graduate student at Seton Hall University. I come from a background in quantitative neuroscience.

My interests include creating data pipelines and applying machine learning methods to help drive company insights. 

I am passionate about learning, programming, and mathematics.
